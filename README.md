# The Ordinary Time-Employee Management System with IoT (TOTEMS)

# Introduction

Hypersomnia or excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a condition in which people feel excessive sleepiness during the day (Healthline, 2016). People with hypersomnia will find difficulties during the day. The symptoms may affect work, study and functioning in their life. It is necessary to diagnose the hypersomnia by several tests performed by the doctor. Thus, the doctor can plan the appropriate treatment process, which may be different in each patient. However, patients could be suffering during the treatment process because the symptoms disturb their life. Some people do not even know about this sleep disorder and blame themselves (Hypersomnia Foundation, n.a.). In the long term, they will have problems in their daily activities. For example, a student can find struggling to maintain studying in class or doing self-study. An employee can be looked like an unprofessional and unproductive person. Or people may get a car accident while driving. 

The aim of this project is to support people with Hypersomnia, we believe that we can implement The Ordinary Time-Employee Management System (TOTEMS), which integrates a set of devices under the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) at workplaces (e.g., office desk or driver’s seat) to detect some signs of sleepiness and wake the people up. The IoT approach is chosen because it is one of the most practical ways to automatically recognize the gesture of users in real-time. The system can be set up to the various working places of individual and it will work silently.

# Proposed Solution

The design of TOTEMS is based on 2 techniques, Webcam Eye Tracker and Text-to-Speech. This high-level diagram shows how the prototype of TOTEMS will be installed at the user’s desk.

The system will consist of 3 main components as shown in the following block diagram:
1.	Camera module or USB webcam as an image sensor.
2.	IoT board, sleepiness detection and text to speech processes as a control center.
3.	Speaker as an actuator.
